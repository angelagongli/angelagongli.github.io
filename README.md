# React Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio site is written in JS/JSX using React, and dynamically renders 3 tabs, Home, Portfolio and Contact, on one page.

You can find my portfolio at my GitHub user page: https://angelagongli.github.io/

## Credits
This single-page [React](https://reactjs.org/) application was built with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and deployed to GitHub Pages using the [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) node package.

The background image on the left side of the page was taken from the free library of patterns at [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). The photographs on the right side of the page are by [Samuel McGarrigle](https://unsplash.com/@tempographics), [Liam Burnett-Blue](https://unsplash.com/@liamburnettblue) and [Mahkeo](https://unsplash.com/@mahkeo) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

The favicon image and icons were taken from the collection of icons at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and the page styling uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework as its base.

The header font is from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
